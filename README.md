# AdventureWorks-Sales-Analysis

#### Overview
This is an analysis of available sales data for AdventureWorks, a retailer of bicycles, parts, and apparel. The goal is to provide visualization of trends and figures that could be helpful to key business leaders. It consists of three sheets: first, a simple line graph showing overall sales over a span of three years; second, a breakdown of sales channel by product category; and finally, a series of charts that show profits from each product category. These visualizations demonstrate that Microsoft's Power BI is an effective tool for analyzing data and presenting insights.

#### Data
The data are provided in the form of an Excel file with multiple sheets. This file is freely available for download from Microsoft's website https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/desktop-dimensional-model-report#get-data-download-the-sample. 

#### Results
Looking at the sum of sales over time by year, it would appear that 2019 was the most profitable year. However, considering sales by month and year shows that there are many peaks and valleys, and the last data point happens to be lower than the peak of 2019. It is also worth mentioning that the data only cover the first half of 2020, whereas all sales of 2019 are considered. Thus, while a trend line shows that sales have steadily increased, it is advisable to maintain sufficient cash reserves to weather the slow periods. If more data about the overall business budgets were available, a recommendation for the amount of this cash reserve could be calculated. 

The greatest count of product category sold directly by the company's website is accessories. Though a significant number of orders for bikes and clothing were also sold online, they, along with bicycle components, are heavily sold by resellers. This indicates that business relationships with these resellers are currently crucial to AdventureWorks. However, it could also be worth considering opening proprietary physical storefronts as well.

The most profitable product subcategories sold are road bikes and mountain bikes, with HL Road Frame and HL Mountain Frame as the two most profitable product models. Thus, marketing and sales efforts should consider prioritizing these products in order to maximize profits.
